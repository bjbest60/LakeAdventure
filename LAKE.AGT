INTRODUCTION
                                                                               
You are Eddie Hughes, a 13-year-old boy who lives on Okauchee Lake in          
Wisconsin. The object is to get to your friend Erica's birthday party! Erica
is the kid sister of your best friend Richard. You can travel on land, as well
as on water using your trusty aluminum boat! Of course, you must do a few
things before the boat is operable. Such as, where did you leave that gas tank?
The birthday party is this afternoon. Good luck!                                                                     
                                                                               
### I am Ed Hughes and I'm not thirteen and I don't live in Wisconsin. Heh. I  
can't believe I even found these disks. Yeah. I was cleaning out a closet
because what else are you supposed to do these days. I emailed the IT
department at work to see if they could transfer them to something from this
century. One guy had set up an old rig in his basement. Guess everyone's bored
during quarantine. Yeah. It was like a little drug deal. Heh. I just dropped
the disks on his doorstep in a paper bag.                              
                                                                               
### Everything okay by you?

### Hmm. Yeah ... yeah, I get that. I mean, this is the most time I've ever
spent with my daughter, which is great, but it's hard not to feel ... lonely,
I guess, like you said. I dunno. I guess we'll see.

### Anyway, she's gonna need the computer in like an hour or something. She's
got this study group some of her friends set up. History class. Yeah. And
apparently something's wrong with her Chromebook right now. The whole online
high school thing is weird to me, but what isn't weird these days with all this
COVID stuff. I guess some people are saying the shutdown could last for months.
I'm already tired of it after three weeks or whatever. Heh.

### And the game's running fine and everything? Great. I'm glad. I'm still
getting used to all this videoconferencing. Yeah, I can read your screen. But--
hmm. Actually, things are pretty small. Let me see if I can zoom in a bit in
the browser. There we go. I don't know where my readers are at the moment.
Yeah, yeah, middle age sucks.

### No. I was bummed I couldn't figure it out--I'm not sure what I was doing
wrong. Maybe it's because I have a Mac. I used to be so good with computers.
Heh. But I'm glad you got it to work. It'll be fun to laugh at. Probably not as
fun as trivia night at Dave's, or hell, just going to a coffee shop would be
real good right now. But who knows when that'll be possible again.                           
                                                                               
### I mean, the game's ancient; I dunno. Definitely ancient history. It's
weird--I was really obsessed with this for a while but now I hardly remember
any of it. So I'm interested to see whatever I wrote. Hey, cool. You're in
my room now. The map was my real house. I think you can just exit the bed.
Okay. This'll be fun. ###

### So, my house in the game is definitely my house as a kid, but we sure as

lived in Milwaukee. Milwaukee was kinda weird in that it very clearly had
poorer sections and richer sections, and literally you would cross a single
street and be in a very different part of town. Maybe a lot of cities are like
that. I dunno.

### Anyway, we weren't poor, at least that's what my mom always told me. But we
definitely didn't live with the rich people. Richard did, though we went to the
same schools. But it was never ... I guess it was never a big deal back then.
Yeah. "You're two peas in a pod," his mother always said. Heh. We loved the
same TV shows and books and stuff like that. His folks had a cottage out west
of the suburbs in the country on this lake. Yeah. Okauchee. I really loved it
there. ###

something. Heh. My work friend said it wasn't on the disks I gave him. I'm not
sure. Maybe I saved over some of the code or something.

MESSAGE [You hurl the acid-filled bottle]
You hurl the acid-filled bottle at Luke. The syrupy green substance lands on 
his head and starts trickling down. You watch as it burns away his clothes, his
skin, his organs, until only his skeleton remains. It smells awful. The
skeleton lingers for a moment. "Do you think it's that easy to kill me?" it
asks, then falls into green dust which blows into the lake.

### Jesus. Yeah, right? What the hell happened to a fun little game about going
on the lake and to a birthday party? I must have been older. I must have
changed and rechanged this damn game a million times. ###

A bully at your school says something one last time about your sister, and you
break. You lower your shoulder and charge him, smashing him into the wall and
knocking the wind out of him. You straddle him after he falls. And, even
though he's significantly larger, you proceed to beat the absolute shit out of
him. It takes two teachers and a nearby football player to drag you off.

You are suspended from school for a week and are charged with misdemeanor 
battery. Your mother never says anything about it. She puts bandages on your
injuries. She drives you to court. She hangs up new curtains she's made in your
room.

### No. You know, I--I really don't remember when this stopped being some goofy
game and started becoming more of ... a diary. Maybe I thought no one would
ever play it.

### Heh. Yeah, lucky you.

### I mean, yeah, sorta. I took this creative writing class in high school.
Had a great teacher. Mrs. Garcia. I guess I did take my writing seriously for
a while. But after this game I never wrote another damn thing.

### Anyway, I'm pretty sure I remember what comes next, so I'll just keep quiet
about it. Into the belly of the beast. Hope you like more halls. ###

him. He was on the football team and had new jock friends. I never even went to
his cottage on the lake again. I thought it was a joke when I heard he died.
But no. Car crash, senior year. He was celebrating his eighteenth birthday
with his friends, and he was drunk. Wrapped his car around a tree. Wasn't
wearing a seat belt like an idiot.

he had goddamn near everything, and he threw it all away.

I graduated high school, I left. Which kinda makes me like my father, which

why I wound up in Virginia. Thought maybe I'd join the Navy. Never did. My mom

matters? ###

it's worth it. She's probably got a degree in it or whatever. And she's giving
us a test that we're all freaking out about. So I *need* the computer. Now.
Please. +++
