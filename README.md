AGT files for LAKE Adventure, 2nd place, <a href="https://ifcomp.org/comp/2023">2023 Interative Fiction Competition</a>

These files are provided for those interested in seeing the code for a modern-day game written in <a href="https://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/programming/agt/">AGT</a> (Adventure Game Toolkit).  The files are compatible with AGT Master's Edition 1.6.  I did the coding in VS Code, frequently using DOSBox to compile and verify the latest changes.

LAKE.AGT contains the primary source code.  Ancillary files are also provided if they altered some prewritten AGT behavior; LAKE.STD is the most important, as it changes a few default responses into something slightly more helpful.  LAKE.PCX is the title image displayed at the beginning of the game when running it in DOS.

These files must be compiled to get a playable version of the game.  For use in a modern IF interpreter (Gargoyle, Spatterlight, or AGiliTy), the .AGT file must be transformed to an .AGX file via the AGT2AGX.EXE utility.
